"""Render a page in a real browser, for content behind client-side JS.

A plain HTTP fetch sees whatever the server sends before any script runs. For
most sites that's the whole page; for a genuine client-rendered wall (x.com
serves a "JavaScript is not available" noscript page to any client that
doesn't execute JS) it's nearly nothing, and no amount of smarter HTML parsing
recovers content that was never in the response.

Optional dependency: install with `local-first-common[playwright]` and run
`playwright install chromium` once. The import happens inside the function,
not at module load, so a tool that never calls this never needs the browser
installed at all — importing this module is always safe.
